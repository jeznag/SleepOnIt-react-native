Is this possible?
Sally,

We cannot provide the email to support as proof to a solicitor, I would suggest that we cc support in however email the customer with a copy of this email also in future(so that we have a copy of the email which goes out to the customer itself) as a temporary work-around.

I have noticed also that Mandrill does not display the body of an email even if we are able to locate the record of it within their dashboard. This largely defeats the purpose of having a facility which stores these emails as we are not able to prove what had actually articulated within where we are prompted for it.

Hi Sally,

I checked zoho support, and the renewal notice I can find is the one sent to Accounts. I also checked my gmail and it shows that the notice was sent to my SR email. I already raised this concern to the zoho guys that went to your office last month.

I have not been able to locate the renewal notice for this particular customer despite the renewal notice supposedly being sent 16/09/15(renewal date 16/10/15).

I gave you access to mandrill and mina showed you how to search it. She also updated it for greater history. Does this not work?

Hi Sally

As previously advised, we have had ongoing issues with customers demanding copies of important emails(e.g., renewal notices etc.) for quite a while and I wanted to follow up as to whether we have been able to work around this issue and/or an alternate solution altogether has been found.

We have had an additional request for a copy of the renewal notice for- https://crm.zoho.com/crm/EntityInfo.do?module=Accounts&id=910075000002655072
